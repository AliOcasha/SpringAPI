# Spring-API
Creating a _Backend API_ using **Spring Boot in Java** for a pseudo-school.  
Managing Students and Teachers using _GET, POST, PUT and DELETE_ Requests configured to needs.  

This Application then will be **Docker**-ized running in containers ( one for the actual app and one for the postgres database).  
Lastly **Kubernetes** will be added to the project to manage the containers at run time.  
As an optional extra I will write Unite and Integration-Tests for the Application.  
  
This Project was created as a Preparation for my first programming job. As part of this preparation I will also read into Azure.  

All Tech Stacks mentioned are learned fresh and applied for the first-time in a project.
